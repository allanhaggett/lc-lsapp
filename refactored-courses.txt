 I've completely refactored courses.php with the following improvements:

  Key Changes:

  1. Cleaner Code Structure

  - Centralized all filters into a single $filters array
  - Removed duplicate code and complex string concatenation
  - Added helper functions for query string management

  2. Better Filter Management

  - Created buildQueryString() function to handle query parameters
  - Created getFilterLink() function to generate filter links consistently
  - All filters now preserve other active filters when clicked

  3. Added Platform Filtering

  - Dynamically extracts unique platforms from all courses
  - Platform filter section added to the sidebar
  - Works seamlessly with all other filters

  4. Improved Code Readability

  - Clear variable names and logical flow
  - Consistent formatting and structure
  - Proper escaping with h() function where needed
  - Better separation of concerns

  5. Enhanced UI/UX

  - Used Bootstrap 5.3's color mode-aware classes (bg-light-subtle, bg-dark-subtle)
  - Consistent badge styling for all filters
  - Clear visual distinction between active filters (dark with ×) and available filters (light)
  - Added "N/A" fallback for empty platform and partner fields

  6. Performance Improvements

  - Single pass through courses for filtering
  - Efficient platform extraction
  - Cleaner HTML output with less redundancy

  The filtering system now works more intuitively - clicking any filter preserves all other active filters, and clicking an active filter (with the × symbol) removes only that filter while keeping others active.
